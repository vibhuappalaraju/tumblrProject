# Lab 1 - *tumblrProject*

**tumblrProject** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)
- [x] User can "Pull to refresh" the tumblr feed
Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to add a search property to look through descriptions

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

For some reason I had to manually adjust the height of the cells instead of being able to do it from storyboard. I also had a little trouble adjust the cell size to make sure the UIImage fit inside and did not look too stretched.
